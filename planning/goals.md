# Goals for this project

## Intro

My Project is called Grapevine. Think of it as a news aggregate the centers around local buzz. Users can submit articles about a topic on their choice. Users can also make comments.

## MVP

For this project the MVP would consist of:

- full CRUD on a post
- CRU on a comment
- a mildly presentable layout
  For the most part, as long as the app can basically function.

## Silver

This category would have all of the above and:

- A more robust design: something that looks professional, and very clean-cut
- Full CRUD on the comments
- Basic User authentication, with the current user displayed somewhere on page
- A nice looking sign-in form
- A Daily Topic

The silver tier adds a few more features, but the focus here is mostly appearance.

## Gold

The Gold category is all about adding complexity for a truly unique user experience. I would like to add:

- A feature where Users have to be logged in to see content
- Non-local authentication (Sign-in with Facebook! Sign-in with Twitter!!)
- Upvotes and Downvotes on comments: these can shuffle the order of the comments
- Adding tags to posts where they can be sorted
- Adding a search feature
- Color pallets that users can change (I even came up with a few)

These features are quite ambitious but my goal overall in this project is to complete the MVP, have at least three Silver features and at least one Gold Feature.
